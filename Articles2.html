                Most youngsters would agree that learning how to manage money is an important life skill. Yet so far hardly any high school or college students are required to take any form of personal finance education. Perhaps it's not surprising then that only 27% of Indian adults and 17% of Indian Teens are financially literate, leaving many without the skills they need to make smart money decisions.
              </h3><p></p> 
              <h3 class="left-align">But this gap can be filled by learning about money management and understanding everyday financial literacy lessons on spending and saving.</h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                To get you started, here are five pieces of money advice:
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align"><b> 1. Be honest about needs and wants:</b></h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                Learn the difference between needs and wants, food, clothing and shelter are needs, while toys, movies and trips are wants. For older students, however, the nuance can get lost when it comes to distinguishing between some needs and wants, such as:
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3>•	Home-cooked meals (need) vs. fast food (want);</h3>
              <h3>•	College clothes (need) vs. designer duds (want);</h3>
              <h3>•	Student housing (need) vs. their own apartment.</h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
               <b> 2. Create a budget that encourages saving:</b>
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                While some students might think a budget is all about deprivation, understand what a budget really is: a system of spending that helps you achieve your goals. Without a budget, it's all too easy to spend every last rupee you've got coming in before you can even think about saving. By creating a budget that considers both monthly income and expenses, you can see where there might be opportunities to save. 
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                Of course, there are various ways of setting up a budget and choosing a method that works with a student's personality is key to helping them stick to it. For example, a traditional budget sets a spending limit for each expense (e.g., food, accommodation, tuition, books, entertainment, etc.), and whatever amount is left at the end of the month goes toward savings.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                But if money tends to burn a hole in your  pocket, a traditional budget won't help you save since there will rarely be any cash left at the end of the month. Instead, a reverse budget (also called “pay yourself first") could be a better option, since a slice of earnings (part-time job salary, scholarships, interest income, etc.) comes off the top and is set aside for savings.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                One simple budgeting tactic that encourages saving is the 50/30/20 method, which recommends spending 50% of your after-tax income on needs (such as housing, food, books, etc.), 30% on wants (such as dining out, entertainment and shopping) and 20% on savings.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                If you are tech-savvy, they could also download a budgeting app to help you track cash flow.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
               <b> 3. Be a smart shopper:</b>
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                We've all heard the advice to buy items when they're on sale, but discounts aren't always the bargain they're made out to be. Stores have various price points for the stock they sell, which means one retailer's "sale" price could be the same as another's regular price. So make sure you know how to compare by finding out what similar products sell for elsewhere.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                But, more importantly, remind yourself that a sale only saves you money if the discount is on something you were going to buy anyway. If, for example, a new pair of jeans is half-price, but you weren't planning to buy jeans because you already have a couple of pairs in good condition, that purchase would needlessly increase your spending rather than save you money.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
               <b> 4. Don't wait to start saving:</b>
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                Students often think they'll have an easier time saving when they earn more money, but the truth is saving is about a mindset of living within your means. After all, income is only half the equation, and many people end up increasing their spending every time they get a better-paying job or a raise. The real secret to saving is keeping spending in check.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                If that argument doesn't sway you, hit yourself with this one instead: the earlier you start saving, the more “free" money you can get thanks to the power of compound interest. When you put savings into a bank account that pays compound interest, you earn a percentage in interest on your deposits—and on any previous interest you already accumulated. In other words, your savings will snowball over time, and the earlier you start building that snowball, the faster it will grow.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
               <b> 5. Choose the right savings accounts:</b>
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                Now that you are convinced how important it is to save, select the best savings accounts/ Investments to achieve your goals. For short-term savings—money that will be spent on tuition or other expenses in the near future—look for an account that offers access to the funds at any time without penalty, such as Liquid Funds/Ultra Short Term Mutual Funds.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                A Fixed Deposit may pay more interest, but there are often minimum deposit requirements and you can't withdraw the money until the maturity date, so it's best for longer-term savings like a car purchase or a down payment on a home.
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                "Financial literacy helps college student's achieve success"
              </h3><p></p>
              <h3 class="left-align">
                Although financial literacy lessons may not be as intuitive as learning how to cook or clean, they are all important life skills that will set young adults on a path to success. So take the time to learn about the importance of saving money and managing finances while you are still young. It will not only help you to save money but also keep yourself away from making costly mistakes....
